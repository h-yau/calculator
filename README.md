## Introduction

As a part of my journey in the Odin Project, this On-Screen Calculator project is an opportunity for me to apply my knowledge and skills in a real-world scenario. I have built a calculator with interactive buttons, display functionality, and the ability to perform arithmetic operations.

## Project Overview

In this project, I have:

- Create functions for basic math operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide).
- Implement a function to evaluate expressions using the above operations.
- Build a basic HTML calculator with digit buttons and operator buttons.
- Implement display functionality to show numbers and results.
- Handle user input and perform calculations based on the chosen operation.
- Add error handling for scenarios like division by zero.
- Incorporate advanced features like decimal input and backspace.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the initial calculator layout.
3. Begin coding the JavaScript and CSS files to implement the project features.
4. Test your calculator's functionality and make adjustments as needed.

## Features

The calculator project will have the following core features:

- Buttons for digits (0-9) and basic math operations (+, -, *, /).
- Display area to show entered numbers and calculation results.
- Functionality to perform calculations based on user input.
- Clear button to reset the calculator.
- Error handling for division by zero and other potential issues.
- Decimal button to input floating-point numbers.
- Styling improvements to make the calculator visually appealing.
- Backspace button to undo input mistakes.
- Keyboard support for input and operations.
